# EdgeVision-Advanced-Mobile-ALPR-System
Project Description
EdgeVision: Advanced Mobile ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) System is an innovative project aiming to simplify and enhance vehicle number plate recognition. This system makes use of the state-of-the-art YOLO v8 for object detection to accurately detect car number-plates, coupled with the powerful EasyOCR for text detection and recognition on the detected number-plates.

Our mission is to provide an efficient, reliable, and easy-to-integrate solution for vehicle number-plate recognition tasks.
